<P>“In the Age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational 
    chanting to worship [Lord Caitanya,] the incarnation of Godhead who 
    constantly sings the names of Krsna. Although His complexion is not blackish, 
    He is Krsna Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons, 
    and confidential companions.”

    “Those who are actually advanced in knowledge are able to appreciate the essential value 
    of this Age of Kali. Such enlightened persons worship Kali-yuga because in this fallen age all 
    perfection of life can easily be achieved by the performance of sankirtana.”</P>
